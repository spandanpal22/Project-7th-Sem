# Facial Expression Recognition

- Recognizes 7 types of facial expressions - Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise.
- The dataset used for training is FER2013 which is an open source dataset.
- I have already trained the model and provided the .h5 file and created a Flask app to use that trained model to detect facial expressions. 
- Download the trained model from the given link : <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bJJRHL9WcvjbDuNMoR8a5R6C2JxdZhOl/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download Trained Model .h5 File</a>
- In the videos folder I have given two videos, you can use your own as well by making one change in the camera.py file in the VideoCapture() function, to test it.
